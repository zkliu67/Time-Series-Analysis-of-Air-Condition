# Time-Series-Analysis-And-Forecast-of-Air-Condition in New York City

### ZEKUN LIU
This repository contains the project for thoroughly analysing the daily air condition (SO2 AQI) dataset for New York City from 2001 to 2016, along with the predition for the next three years. 

- The analysis focuses on understanding all elements of the given time series dataset, namely, trend, seasonality and residuals. 

- To achieve accurate extraction, two models, SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) and SSA (Spectrum Singular Analysis) are applied and compared to obtained the better result. 

- SARIMA is achieved with Python while SSA with R.
